<h1>The Sonnet: History and Forms</h1>

<blockquote>
  Eternal glory to the inventor of the sonnet. — Paul Valery
</blockquote>

<p>Amongst contemporary poets, the sonnet is alive and well! Before we get into specifics about the history, traditions and forms of the sonnet, let’s look at a contemporary example and think about the various ways poets continue to work in the form, as well as break with its traditions and “rules.” Here is a link to Mollycat Jones’ “Unholy Sonnet Number One.”</p>

<p>Poet, Mollycat Jones (Christine Potter), in her title is riffing off of metaphysical poet, John Donne’s “Holy Sonnets or Divine Meditations” originally published in the first edition of his Songs and Sonnets (1633). Donne wrote 19 “Holy Sonnets” in direct address to God, and he employed violent and sexual imagery. Donne’s “Holy Sonnets” is one of his most dramatic devotional lyrics.</p>

<p>With wit and in the voice of an angry cat (because the poet slept too late), Jones brings together God and cats in the sonnet form. We love how the cat is the speaker in the poem, and from a superior position, addresses and critiques humans for their slothful forgetfulness.</p>

<p>The poem is a one-stanza 14-line sonnet with a rhyme scheme of abba abba cdcd ee. We scan the first line as: “my BOWL of LAMB and GRA-vy FROM the CAN”—a line of iambic pentameter. This shows how the poet embraces some conventions of the traditional sonnet while making it uniquely her own.</p>

<p>In the ending couplet, there’s a turn (or volta), continuing in the cat’s voice and perspective, in which the cat pronounces that humans are inferior to felines and fit only to serve them.</p>

<h2>Origins of the Sonnet</h2>

<p>Credit for the invention of the form is given to the Italian poet Giacomo de Lentino in the 14th century. It is not, however, Lentino but Francesco Petrarca, known as Petrarch, who is most closely associated with the early form of the sonnet.</p>

<p>Petrarch established the themes and dominated the practice of the Italian sonnet.</p>

<p>Although it’s very likely the English poet Chaucer encountered the form in the late 1300s, it took approximately 200 years for the sonnet form to make its way from Italy to England.</p>

<p>In the mid-1500s Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (usually referred to simply as “Surrey”) and Thomas Campion translated Petrarch into English for the first time.</p>

<p>Surrey is credited with creating the now Standard English form of the sonnet, although that form is more closely associated with Shakespeare, who perfected it.</p>

<h2>General Form</h2>

<p>The sonnet is one of the most recognizable of poetic forms. It is a poem consisting of fourteen lines of iambic pentameter. Not much more can be said by way of set-in-stone definition. In fact, even these absolutes have been challenged. Shakespeare wrote one 15-line sonnet. Others have written 16-line poems they have called sonnets. Some, like Philip Sidney, have written iambic hexameter or other lines in what otherwise are called sonnets.</p>

<p>However, these two criteria remain fundamental for sonnets written in English: 14 lines of iambic pentameter. Beyond that, sonnets generally are divided into sub-stanzas, differently depending on the subgenre.</p>

<p>Sonnets generally have a volta, or “turn.” The volta is where the sonnet suddenly switches direction. The poet will seem to be saying one thing and then start saying another.</p>

<p>The volta may bring about the answer at the end of a sonnet or correct a false claim, as in Michael Drayton’s Sonnet 61 in which he tells us in the first part, “I’m so glad we broke up,” and in the second, “But can we get back together.”</p>

<h2>Francesco Petrarca (1304-1374)</h2>

<h2>Recognizable Versions of the Sonnet</h2>

<h3>Petrarchan (Italian) Version</h3>

<p>The most common subject of the sonnet is love, particularly unrequited love from the perspective of a man. Here is an example by Sir Thomas Wyatt:</p>

<pre>
Whoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,
But as for me, hélas, I may no more.
The vain travail hath wearied me so sore,
I am of them that farthest cometh behind.
Yet may I by no means my wearied mind
Draw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore
Fainting I follow. I leave off therefore,
Sithens in a net I seek to hold the wind.
Who list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,
As well as I may spend his time in vain.
And graven with diamonds in letters plain
There is written, her fair neck round about:
Noli me tangere, for Caesar’s I am,
And wild for to hold, though I seem tame.
</pre>

<p>An Italian sonnet is not defined primarily by its subject matter. A sonnet can be about anything. The word refers only to the form: the line, the stanza, and the rhyme scheme.</p>

<pre>
Who so wish to hunt, I know where is an hind          a
But as for me, alas, I may no more;                 b
The vain travail has wearied me so sore,             b
I am of them that furthest come behind.             a
Yet may I by no means my weary mind                a
Draw from the deer: but as she flees before,        b
Fainting, I follow. I leave off therefore,         b
Since in a net I seek to hold the wind.            a
Who so wish to hunt, I put him out of doubt,       c
He as well as I may spend his time in vain;        d
And carved with diamonds in letters plain           e
There is written, her fair neck round about,       c
No one may touch me, for Caesar’s I am,           d
And wild to hold, although I may seem tame.       d

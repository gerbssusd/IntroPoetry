# How to Read a Poem  
### (& Maybe Fall in Love with Poetry)

> “Reading poetry is an adventure in renewal, a creative act, a perpetual beginning, a rebirth of wonder.”  
> — Edward Hirsch

# Are Poems “Open to Interpretation”?

- **Yes — but not without limits**
- All language is inherently open to interpretation  
- Poets *intentionally* exploit ambiguity and multiple meanings
- Yet, not all interpretations are equal:
  - Some are **defensible**, others are not  
  - Meaning depends on evidence in the poem

# Common Barriers to Understanding Poetry

| Challenge | What It Means | How to Approach |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Difficult ideas** | Complex or abstract concepts | Ask questions; discuss |
| **Old or unusual language** | Archaic or specialized vocabulary | Use a dictionary |
| **Unusual syntax** | Inverted or complex sentence structures | Identify subject and verb |
| **Distracting sound or rhythm** | Musical language can obscure meaning | Practice; reread aloud |

# Poetry as the Art of Language

- Poetry is a **specialized use of language** — it’s art made from words  
- Poets are always searching for **new subjects** and **new expressions**  
- Reading poetry = learning a **new dialect** of your own language  
- Persistence is key — *keep reading!*

---

# How to Approach a Poem

1. **Read it at least three times**
   - First: just read the words
   - Second: focus on sound and rhythm
   - Third: look for meaning
2. **Read aloud** whenever possible
3. **Look for sentences**, not line breaks
4. **Try paraphrasing** in your own words

---

# Finding Meaning

- Meaning often lies in **sentence structure** and **story**
- Ask:
  - Who is speaking?
  - What’s happening?
  - Where and when does it occur?
- Remember:  
  The **speaker** is not always the **poet**

---

# Example: Emily Dickinson  
### *“A narrow Fellow in the Grass”*

> A boy mistakes a snake for a whip — and feels “zero at the bone.”

- The speaker is a **boy**, but Dickinson was not  
- The poem is **not autobiographical** — it’s a crafted perspective  
- Shows how poets **create voices** for effect

---

# Reading in Community

- Poetry was originally **communal**, not solitary  
- When you’re stuck:
  - Discuss with peers  
  - Post your thoughts and interpretations  
- Conversation leads to understanding

---

# The Music of Meaning

- Meaning in poetry is **inseparable from sound**
- The **music** of language carries emotional and symbolic power
- Example: tone, rhythm, and delivery can *change* meaning  
  > “I love you,” whispered ≠ “I love you!” shouted

---

# Key Takeaways

- Poems are open to interpretation — **but not anything goes**
- **Read actively**: aloud, repeatedly, and in context
- Distinguish **speaker vs. poet**
- Attend to both **meaning and music**
- Above all:  
  *Enjoy the process of discovery.*

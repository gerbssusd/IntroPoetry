  <h1>Some Other Genres: Ode, Ballad, Elegy, Epic, Dramatic Monologue, Villanelle, Sestina</h1>

  <p>Lyric, Narrative, Dramatic, the ancient distinction, held until the 18th century. It derives from Aristotle (who used the word “epic” rather than “narrative”). From the 19th century on, it has lost categorical force.</p>

  <p><strong>Lyric:</strong> poetry written from the first-person point of view of the poet. Originally poems intended to be recited or sung to the accompaniment of a lyre.</p>

  <p><strong>Narrative:</strong> epic poetry, poetry that tells a story in which a variety of characters speak and interact. What had been the stuff of narrative poetry has become the purview of novels and prose fiction nowadays.</p>

  <p><strong>Dramatic:</strong> poetry told in the point of view of a character.</p>

  <p>This categorization of types held from the time of Aristotle (4th C. BCE) until the time of Johnson (18th C. CE). Most poetry today, however, is written in the lyric mode. “Dramatic” and “Narrative” being largely taken over by prose fiction. The subgenres, mostly subgenres of lyric, must still be recognized, however.</p>

  <h2>The Ode</h2>
  <p>The ode comes in a number of flavors—Pindaric, Horatian, English, Irregular. Its origins are in the Latin poetry of the Roman Empire, and there its form is very strict. Some English poets imitated Latin form. But most practitioners of the Ode in English have taken only some of the particulars of the Ancient ode to heart as they reproduce the form. The ode is a longer poem, serious or meditative in nature, commonly about events of a public nature, written in formal language and usually having a strict stanzaic structure.</p>

  <p>Regular odes, such as those of Keats, are often composed in very elaborate stanzas. Students often find these difficult to read both because of the form and because of the elaborate language.</p>

  <pre>
My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
‘Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
But being too happy in thine happiness,—
That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees
In some melodious plot
Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,
Singest of summer in full-throated ease.
  </pre>

  <p>Irregular ode example:</p>

  <pre>
There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common sight,
To me did seem
Apparelled in celestial light,
The glory and the freshness of a dream.
It is not now as it hath been of yore;—
Turn wheresoe’er I may,
By night or day.
The things which I have seen I now can see no more.
  </pre>

  <h2>Ballad</h2>
  <p>Folk and Literary: one of the oldest reasons that poems have rhyme and meter is that these elements made the poems easier to memorize. Preliterate people used them also for their mnemonic power. Ballads are narrative, often with dialogue and a strong story focus.</p>

  <h2>Elegy</h2>
  <p>An elegy is a poem of lamentation, often mourning the death of a person or reflecting on sorrow more generally. Elegies traditionally follow a three-part structure: lament, praise, consolation.</p>

  <h2>Epic</h2>
  <p>An epic is a long narrative poem recounting heroic deeds, often with a national, cultural, or legendary significance. Epics include elevated style, vast settings, and often divine intervention in human affairs.</p>

  <h2>Dramatic Monologue</h2>
  <p>A dramatic monologue is a poem in which a single character speaks to a silent audience, revealing aspects of their personality and situation. The focus is on character rather than plot.</p>

  <h2>Villanelle</h2>
  <p>A villanelle is a nineteen-line poem with two repeating rhymes and two refrains. The form consists of five tercets followed by a quatrain. Famous example: Dylan Thomas’ “Do not go gentle into that good night.”</p>

  <h2>Sestina</h2>
  <p>A sestina is a complex form consisting of six stanzas of six lines each, followed by a three-line envoi. The end words of the first stanza rotate in a set pattern through the remaining stanzas. The sestina emphasizes intricate repetition and variation.</p>

  <p>These forms demonstrate the wide range of structures, styles, and intentions possible in poetry beyond the more familiar lyric and sonnet forms. Understanding them can enrich both reading and writing experiences.</p>

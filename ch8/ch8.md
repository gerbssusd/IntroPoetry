*Understanding the structure and impact of poetic forms*

---

## What is Poetic Form?
- Organizes content of a poem
- Exists along a spectrum:
  - **Closed forms:** structured, patterned
  - **Open forms:** flexible, free-flowing
- Form shapes meaning and reading experience

---

## Closed Form
- Follows specific rules for:
  - Rhyme
  - Meter
  - Line length
  - Stanza structure
- Creates **order, rhythm, and unity**
- Examples: Sonnet, Villanelle, Haiku

---

- Types:
  - **Shakespearean (English):** 3 quatrains + 1 couplet (ABAB CDCD EFEF GG)
  - **Petrarchan (Italian):** Octave ABBAABBA + sestet CDECDE/CDCDCD
- Often explores themes of love, mortality, or time

    <p><strong>Audio:</strong> Alice B. Fogel reads Robert Bly’s “Starting a Poem.” (original media available at the source)</p>

    <blockquote>“In my view a good poem is one in which the form of the verse and the joining of its parts seems light as a shallow river flowing over its sandy bed.” — BASHO (Translated by Lucien Stryk)</blockquote>

    <p>Some say a poem is a kind of song or a prayer; it’s both controlled and uncontrollable, a flight of the imagination, or it comes from a dream state. It is both inspiration (breath &amp; movement) and perspiration (a poet’s practice of craft).</p>

    <p>A poem is a made thing. And, according to poet Ed Hirsch, writing a poem “is a soul-making activity . . . [p]oems communicate before they are understood and the structure operates on, or inside, the reader even as the words infiltrate the consciousness.”</p>

    <h2>Poetry and Music</h2>
    <p>Imagine yourself driving down the road, listening to your favorite song, either singing along or just grooving to the beat. Your passenger in the seat next to you asks, innocently, “What does this song mean?” You stop; you think. It’s your favorite song. But what can you say?</p>
    <p>“No idea. I just like it.”</p>
    <p>Do you feel bad about that? We hope not. You are welcome to “just like it.” Who says you can’t like a song just because it feels good, or sounds good, or makes you happy?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Of course, we can ask what the song is about, what it means, but we know we don’t have to ask in order to like it.</li>
      <li>We also probably know that the meaning of a song is not limited to the lyrics; a song expresses its meaning through the lyrics and the music.</li>
      <li>Poems have a lot in common with music. Poems can be enjoyed for their sound and rhythm alone, or even for their structure; they can be appreciated for how they make us feel without conscious consideration of meaning. But they also have a meaning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Five Myths That Make Poems Harder to Love</h2>
    <p>In our more than 30 years of teaching poetry in colleges and universities, we’ve observed that students tend to approach the subject from certain common half-truths or misconceptions. We’ll call them myths. Although these myths are not true and not even compatible with each other, a number of students believe all of them.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>It’s all subjective:</strong> Some students believe that poems have no real meanings at all. When they read a poem, these students think, “I can think anything I want about the poem. It’s all interpretation, and there are no right and wrong answers.”</li>
      <li><strong>Poems are nothing but ideas that rhyme:</strong> Some students insist that poetry is the practice of putting “ideas” into rhyme. In other words, poems are just fancied-up ideas with rhyme stuck on to make it fun-sounding.</li>
      <li><strong>Poetry is just a form of self-expression:</strong> Many students believe poetry is mainly about “expressing yourself” or, more specifically, about “expressing your emotions.”</li>
      <li><strong>Poetry is all about how it makes us feel:</strong> Some think that feelings alone justify a reading, regardless of the poem’s words or intentions.</li>
      <li><strong>Poems give advice:</strong> Students who assume poems boil down to simple wisdom or clichés, e.g., “Be yourself,” “Live life to the fullest.”</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These five myths are not just common; they are understandable. It’s not hard to see why people who have had only a slight association with poems would believe these things.</p>

    <p>In fact, there is so much going on in most poems that it’s easy to be confused by them. Of these myths or prejudices, only the first one is absolute nonsense. Poems are never meaningless.</p>

    <p>Although some skill may be required in understanding the ways that poetry works, and although people do often debate the meaning of particular poems, poems are made out of sentences; the sentences these poems are made of are English sentences with English words and English grammar and English structures.</p>

    <p>These sentences almost certainly follow the exact same grammatical rules as any written English sentence and, although they do more than most of the sentences not found in poems, they produce meaning in the same way that English sentences always produce meaning. This bears repeating: there is no way of using language that is exclusive to poetry. Not even rhythm and rhyme. If you can read this sentence, you can read or learn to read almost any poem.</p>

    <h2>Final Words</h2>
    <p>So, to repeat ourselves: the most trimmed down answer we can give to our question “What is a poem?” is this: <strong>A poem is a work of resonant, sensual language that provides a unique experience while it makes a unique observation about life.</strong></p>

    <p>That’s not an entirely satisfactory definition. So here are some more thoughts.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Poetry happens when resonance and sensuality combine. This means that “poetry” is a feature (or function) of language in general and is not in any way restricted to poems.</li>
      <li>Not everything that looks like a poem is necessarily poetry; some “poems” may be merely verse (simple ideas that use meter or rhyme merely for decoration).</li>
      <li>While poetry may appear in other places, poems are where poetry must always be.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Example of verse that the authors deem not a poem:</em></p>
    <pre>
Just Be Yourself

Life is not a rocket race

Each must run at their own pace

All of us have lots to do.

But what matters when we’re through

Isn’t whether we have money

Or even whether we are funny

But how much love we get and give

Love is how we need to live.

Don’t sell your soul to gather wealth.

Just love your friends and be yourself.

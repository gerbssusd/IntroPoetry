<!-- Slide 1: Title -->
# What Is Poetry?  
### When Is a Poem?

> “In my view a good poem is one in which the form of the verse and the joining of its parts seems light as a shallow river flowing over its sandy bed.”  
> — Bashō (trans. Lucien Stryk)

---

<!-- Slide 2: The Nature of Poetry -->
# The Nature of Poetry

- A poem is a **made thing** — intentionally crafted language.  
- Combines **inspiration** (breath, movement) and **perspiration** (craft).  
- Poetry often **communicates before it is fully understood** (Ed Hirsch).  
- It can be **controlled** and **uncontrollable** — like song or prayer.

---

<!-- Slide 3: Poetry and Music -->
# Poetry and Music

- Poems, like songs, blend **sound, rhythm, and meaning**.  
- You can **enjoy** a poem for its sound without immediately decoding its "meaning."  
- Meaning emerges from the interaction of **words + musical qualities**.

---

<!-- Slide 4: Five Myths — intro -->
# Five Myths That Make Poems Harder to Love

> Common misconceptions slow readers down.  These myths are approachable but misleading.

---

<!-- Slide 5: Myth 1 -->
## Myth 1 — "It's all subjective"

- Belief: any interpretation is as good as any other.  
- Reality: poems **produce meaning**; interpretations can be more/less supported by the text.

---

<!-- Slide 6: Myth 2 & 3 -->
## Myth 2 — "Poems = ideas that rhyme"  
- Reality: rhyme or meter alone don't make a poem.

## Myth 3 — "Poetry is only self-expression"  
- Reality: poetry is **crafted experience**, not just emotional venting.

---

<!-- Slide 7: Myth 4 & 5 -->
## Myth 4 — "Poetry is all feeling"  
- Feelings matter, but **words and form** do the work.

## Myth 5 — "Poems are advice"  
- Poems suggest or reveal; they rarely reduce to slogans.

---

<!-- Slide 8: Understanding Poems -->
# Understanding Poems

- Poems use **ordinary grammar and syntax** — no secret code.  
- The same rules of English apply; poems **layer** meaning through form and sound.  
- If you can read English prose, you can learn to read poetry.

---

<!-- Slide 9: Definition -->
# What Makes a Poem a Poem?

**A poem** is:  
> *a work of resonant, sensual language that provides a unique experience while it makes a unique observation about life.*

---

<!-- Slide 10: Resonance + Sensuality -->
# Resonance + Sensuality

- **Resonance:** echoing meaning, associative depth.  
- **Sensuality:** attention to sound, image, texture.  
- Together they create a poetic event — sometimes inside other kinds of writing, but always inside good poems.

---

<!-- Slide 11: Example — Verse vs. Poetry -->
# Example: Verse ≠ Poetry

```text
Just Be Yourself

Life is not a rocket race
Each must run at their own pace
...
Just love your friends and be yourself.

<!-- Slide 13: How to Read a Poem (practical) -->
